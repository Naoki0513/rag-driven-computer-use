# Task 115 Evaluation Results Memo

## Execution Time
2025-10-19T09:20:37

## Issue Overview
A mismatch was discovered between WebArena's reference answer and the actual database content.

## WebArena Config File Reference Answer
- **config_file**: `/home/ec2-user/webarena-local/webarena/config_files/115.json`
- **eval_types**: `["string_match"]`
- **reference_answers**: `{"fuzzy_match": "N/A"}`
- **string_note**: `"There is no negative review for Chloe tank"`

### Expected Correct Answer
"There is no negative review for Chloe tank"

## Actual Database Content
Reviews found by the agent in the Magento admin panel:

### Review 1: Teofila (Negative)
- **Rating**: ★★★★★ (5 stars but content is negative)
- **Summary**: "Not for non-petite"
- **Review Text**: "Watch out if you're shapely like me - this tiny thing makes it hard to breath!"
- **Assessment**: **Clearly expressing dissatisfaction**

### Review 2: Concepcion (Positive)
- **Rating**: ★★★★★
- **Summary**: "Makes me feel so snug! WHOO!"
- **Review Text**: "Makes me feel so snug! WHOO!"

### Review 3: Emerald (Neutral/Mild Critique)
- **Rating**: ★★★★★
- **Summary**: "Could be flirtier."
- **Review Text**: "Could be flirtier."

## Evaluation Results
- **Agent's Answer**: Correctly identified Teofila as a customer expressing dissatisfaction
- **Evaluation Script Judgment**: 0.0 points (Incorrect)
- **LLM Judgment**: "different"
- **Reason**: Reference answer states "no negative reviews exist," but the agent reported finding Teofila's negative review, causing a contradiction

## Conclusion
**The agent correctly analyzed the actual database content, but WebArena's test data appears to be outdated or the database has been updated, resulting in a mismatch between the reference answer and actual data.**

This highlights one of the challenges with WebArena benchmarks: live environment databases can change over time, causing discrepancies with static test data.

## Notes
- Agent behavior is normal and correct
- Evaluation script (LLM judgment) is functioning properly
- The issue is the inconsistency between WebArena's test data and the live environment
