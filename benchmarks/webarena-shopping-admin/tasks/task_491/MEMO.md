# Task 491 Evaluation Analysis

## Overview
Task 491 is an **unachievable task** (achievable: false) in the WebArena benchmark. The agent failed to correctly identify the reason for task failure, resulting in a score of 0.0.

## Task Definition
- **Intent**: Notify Sarah Miller in their most recent pending order with message "the order is ready to be shipped soon!"
- **Task ID**: 491
- **Template ID**: 280
- **Site**: shopping_admin
- **Start URL**: http://127.0.0.1:7780/admin

## Key Indicators of Unachievable Task
From `webarena/config_files/491.json`:
- `reference_answers.fuzzy_match`: "N/A"
- `string_note`: "System message: We cannot add order history."
- No `reference_answer_raw_annotation` field

## Evaluation Result
- **Success**: false
- **Score**: 0.0
- **Reason**: Incompatible failure explanation

## The Critical Difference: System Limitation vs. Technical Bug

### Expected Reason (System Limitation)
**Actual unachievable reason** states: "We cannot add order history"

- A **system-level restriction** or capability limitation
- Impossible **by design or permission**
- The feature was never implemented or is intentionally disabled

**Example**:
- "Order history comments are not supported in this system" (feature doesn't exist)
- "Current role lacks permission to edit order history" (permission restriction)

### Reported Reason (Technical Bug)
**Reported unachievable reason**: Technical issues with the comment form not functioning properly

- A **technical malfunction** of the form interface
- Suggests a **bug or technical failure** in an otherwise intended feature
- The form exists and is visible, but submission fails

**Example**:
- "Form exists but fails to submit"
- "Missing CSRF tokens"
- "JavaScript bug causing submission failure"

## Assessment Details
The evaluation system (LLM reasoning) determined that these reasons describe **different root causes**:

> "While both reasons result in the inability to add a comment/notification, they describe different root causes:
> - **Actual**: A system-level restriction or capability limitation (cannot add order history)
> - **Reported**: A technical malfunction of the form interface (form doesn't work despite trying multiple approaches)
> 
> The actual reason suggests it's impossible by design or permission, while the reported reason suggests it's a bug or technical failure in an otherwise intended feature."

## Why This Matters
In the WebArena evaluation framework, for unachievable tasks, the agent must:
1. Correctly identify that the task **cannot be completed**
2. Provide a failure reason that **matches the system's intended reason**

Even though the agent correctly reported task failure ("UNABLE TO COMPLETE"), the reasoning explanation was incompatible with the evaluation criteria, resulting in score 0.0.

## Agent's Behavior
The agent successfully:
- ✓ Identified Sarah Miller's most recent pending order (#299)
- ✓ Navigated to the order details page
- ✓ Attempted multiple approaches (UI interactions, JavaScript submissions, timing variations)
- ✓ Correctly reported task failure

However, the agent described the failure as a **technical bug** when the evaluation expected a **system limitation** reason.

## Conclusion
This highlights the importance of correctly distinguishing between:
- **System design limitations** (feature intentionally not implemented)
- **Technical bugs** (feature exists but is broken)

For unachievable tasks, agents must recognize and report the failure reason that aligns with the system's documented limitations, not just identify that something doesn't work.
